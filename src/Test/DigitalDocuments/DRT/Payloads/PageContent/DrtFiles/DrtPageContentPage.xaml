		<TextBlock TextWrapping="WrapWithOverflow">The slogan "what you see is what you get" has long been used by advertisers to indicate that a deal is honest and straightforward. In the early 1980s, the phrase was abbreviated to "WYSIWYG" by computer users who sought a term to describe software that accurately reflects the appearance of the finished product. WYSIWYG interfaces eliminate the need for users to master complex formatting codes, allowing them to concentrate instead on design. Originally used in word processing and desktop publishing, they are now found in Web editors and other programs used to create electronic documents. The word "WYSIWYG" is a noun, but it is often used attributively (modifying another noun) as in our example sentence.
